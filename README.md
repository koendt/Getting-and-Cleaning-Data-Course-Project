This repository consists out of the following files:
- a code book: codebook.md, explaining the variables
- R script: run_analysis.R
- a data set: tidyData.txt, the result when running the R script
- a README.md file explaining the R script

The R script, run_analysis.R
- downloads and unpacks the data
- loads the test data and train data
- loads and vectorizes the features and activity labels
- appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
- merges the training sets and test sets
- extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- from the data set in the previous extracting step, creates a second, independent tidy data set, tidyData.txt, with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
